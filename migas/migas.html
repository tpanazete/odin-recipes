        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>900 g ribs</li>
            <li>1 meat sausage</li>
            <li>600 g hard Alentejo bread</li>
            <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>100 g lard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of paprika</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to cook: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the paprika with a little salt and the crushed garlic. Coat the spare ribs with this paste and let it marinate for about 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>After the indicated time, put the lard in a pan, let it heat up, and fry the chorizo, previously cut into slices. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add the ribs cut into pieces, along with the marinade, and fry until the meat is well cooked. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour the fat in which you fried the meat into a non-stick frying pan. Add the sliced bread and a little water and stir very well until the bread crumbles into a thick mixture. Let the breadcrumbs fry on both sides so that they acquire a golden crust, and transfer them to a platter. Arrange the spare ribs and the chorizo over the migas and serve immediately.</li>
