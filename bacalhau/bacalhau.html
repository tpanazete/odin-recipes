            <li>Heat the milk in a pan and add the codfish. When it is cooked, transfer it to a strainer and set the milk aside. Remove the bones and skin and shred the cod.</li>
            <li>Brown the onion and garlic, peeled and chopped, in a pan with the olive oil and bay leaf. Add the butter and flour, stirring constantly, and then add the reserved milk, the egg yolks, and half the cream, little by little and stirring constantly.</li>
